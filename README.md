# Pacmen
The old game came *reloaded!*. This game show you how to make as much pacmen as you like pressing **Add Pacmen** button and they will apear in a random place, then press the **Start Game** button to see how those yellow creatures start moving in a random velocity and when each of them touch the side limits it will flip horizontaly to start its trip to the opposite direction.
You can click on *Restart Game* to start over again.

I hope you enjoy this game! :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
